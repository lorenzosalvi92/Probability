**Statement of the problem**

God flips a fair coin. If heads, he creates one person with a red jacket. If tails, he creates one person with a red jacket, and a million people with blue jackets. 
* Darkness: God keeps the lights in all the rooms off. You wake up in darkness and can't see your jacket. What should your credence be on heads?

**Solution**

Let us first collect the information we know.
* The coin is fair. Therefore $P(H)=P(T)=0.5$.
* If the result of the coin flip is heads, my jacket is sure to be red. Formally, $P(R|H)=1$ - and $P(B|H)=0$.
* If the result of the coin flip is tails, then my jacket is red with probability $\frac{1}{1'000'001}$ and blue with probability $\frac{1.000.000}{1.000.001}$ Formally $P(R|T)=\frac{1}{1.000.001}$ and $P(B|T)\frac{1.000.000}{1.000.001}$.
