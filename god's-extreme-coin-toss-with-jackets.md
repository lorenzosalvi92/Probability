**Statement of the problem**

God flips a fair coin. If heads, he creates one person with a red jacket. If tails, he creates one person with a red jacket, and a million people with blue jackets. 
* Darkness: God keeps the lights in all the rooms off. You wake up in darkness and can't see your jacket. What should your credence be on heads?
