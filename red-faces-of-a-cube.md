The outside of an n $\times$ n $\times$ n cube is painted red. The cube then is choppen into n^3 unit cubes. The latter are thoroughly mixed up and put into a bag. One small cube is withdrawn at random from the bag and tossed acrossed the table. What is the probability that the cube stops with the red face on top?
